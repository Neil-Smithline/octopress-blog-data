* The Good
There are good, or at least, less bad ways of tracking users across websites. While I am shocked at writing this, [[http://bit.ly/LUUGHN][Google]]'s [[http://bit.ly/NuCSSm][AdWords]] service is an example of the good way to advertise. 

Google keeps track of every page that that Google users visit that has an ad served by Google's [[http://bit.ly/NuCSSm][lucrative advertising business]]. To help you understand the magnitude of this, Google's advertising revenue is its primary source of revenue bringing in [[http://bit.ly/NuCSSm][$28 billion in 2010]].

The way it works is:
- Sites want to make money selling ads. 
- The sites talk to Google about selling ads.
- Google gives the site the details about its AdWords advertising. These details include payment schedules, technical details about displaying ads, and the fact that Google will track users who view pages with Google ads on them.
- The site either agrees to this or it doesn't. If the site agrees, it will update its privacy policy if needed. If it doesn't agree, it shops around for other advertisers.

The entire process is open and well-documented. 

I frequently use [[http://bit.ly/NuEhs2][CNN]] as a reference of a typical big-business, high-volume website. Being my /go to/ site for big business, I decided to read their privacy policy. Note that I do not know if CNN uses AdWords or has any relationship with Google. I just used CNN's privacy policy as an example. CNN's privacy policy, conveniently located at [[http://www.cnn.com/privacy.html]], states:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
We, our third party service providers, advertiser or our partners may also use "web beacons" or clear .gifs, or similar technologies, which are small pieces of code placed on a web page, to monitor the behavior and collect data about the visitors viewing a web page. For example, web beacons may be used to count the users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor viewing that page.
#+END_QUOTE
Perhaps that's not the most accessible language but it clearly communicates that you may be tracked by CNN, [[http://bit.ly/NuERGi][third party service providers]], or companies that advertise on CNN's website.

* The Bad
I'll keep this section short. Facebook is notorious for its confusing privacy policies and unnannounced or poorly announced changes to those policies. If you are interested, start clicking links on [[http://bit.ly/NuGRhO][this page]].

* The Ugly
Recently, Facebook announced that it started to [[http://on.mash.to/L789wg][track users via Facebook Like buttons]]. I am at a loss for words to describe how enraged this made me. It wasn't the fact that I was being tracked that bothered me. Like it or not, I know that I'm tracked. 

I also understand that Facebook frequently changes their privacy policy. I can keep up with those changes or not. My choice. But Facebook's decision to track users via their Like button is unlike any other privacy change I have ever heard of. 

For years Facebook has been telling websites about the benefits they get by incorporating a wide range of [[http://bit.ly/NuITyt][Facebook plugins]]. The Facebook Like button [[http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1S19gtdJCXU/TjxsRjitE-I/AAAAAAAAAIw/OEpR4Le562I/s1600/Facebook-like-button.jpg]] is simply ubiquitous across the web. Facebook's privacy change has turned every site that has a Like button on it into a data acquisition service for Facebook's ads. I believe the technical term for this is

* The Infection
When I read about this change to Facebook's privacy policy I immediately recognized that it could potentially affect the privacy of any site with a Like button on it. I then decided to do three things in response to Facebook's decision to suddenly, and without warning, recruit millions of sites into providing data to enable Facebook to increase their advertising revenue:
1. I wrote [[http://bit.ly/M7Igbc][this blog posting]], describing what I thought about Facebook's new privacy policy and the way they handled the change.
1. I created a Twitter account, [[http://bit.ly/NuKVi2][@fb_noprivacy]], just to share my anger via tweets.
1. I started to look for sites that, through no fault of their own, were violating their own privacy policy because of Facebook started tracking users with the Like button.

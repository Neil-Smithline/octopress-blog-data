* The Times They Are a-Changin'
The [[http://bit.ly/LlZzYb][high tech]] industry has always been a tumultuous place. Companies come and go. Today's leaders become tomorrow's losers. Companies boom then bust only to boom again. 

While I have no insight into what [[http://bit.ly/Lm3Z1c][Bob Dylan]] was thinking when he wrote the song, clearly [[http://bit.ly/Lm4c4G][the times they are a-changin']].

* The Changes
While no single change is indicative of a market shake-up, one must notice when drastic changes occur. Have their been drastic changes? I think so but I'll let you decide. As I'm claiming the changes are drastic and happened over a short period of time, I'll only present facts dating back to 2004. 

*** Dates
***** 2005 September                                                        :apple:mobile:
Apple launches its first [[http://bit.ly/N4jsp4][iPod Touch]] and the world will never be the same.

***** 2007 June                                                             :apple:mobile:internet:
The [[http://bit.ly/N4jCwS][original iPhone]] is launched.

***** 2004 February                                                         :facebook:social:biz:internet:
[[http://bit.ly/LmctW9][Facebook was founded]].

***** 2004 August                                                           :google:biz:internet:
[[http://bit.ly/r1GLJZ][Google]] had its now famous [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPO][IPO]].

***** 2004 October                                                          :apple:mobile:internet:
Apple launches the [[http://bit.ly/N4jqxt][first color iPod]].

***** 2007, 2008                                                            :browser:legal:mobile:internet:
[[http://bit.ly/Lm4qJ0][Microsoft]] lost an [[http://bit.ly/Lm5BIv][antitrust]] [[http://1.usa.gov/Lm5LQ7][suit in the US]]. They lost a similar suit in Europe in 2008. The antitrust suits focused on how Microsoft was using its dominance of desktop computers to force its web browser, Internet Explorer, on its customers. Earlier this week, Microsoft [[http://1.usa.gov/Lm5LQ7][exhausted its appeals]] and will have to pay the billion dollar fine from the European suit.

***** 2008 September                                                        :apple:google:microsoft:mozilla:biz:browser:internet:
While calculating [[http://bit.ly/KItM20][web browser]] [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share][market share]] is far from an exact science (see [[http://bit.ly/Lm8okW][Browser usage reports: Lies, damn lies, and statistics]]), the Wikipedia's article on the [[http://bit.ly/Lm8yIR][market share of browsers]] has numerous, frequently contradictory, statistics. Based on the statistics of [[http://bit.ly/Lm8Yz1][StatCounter]], the browser market share was:

     |-------------------+-----|
     | Internet Explorer | 67% |
     | Chrome            |  1% |
     | Firefox           | 26% |
     | Safari            |  3% |
     | Opera             |  3% |
     | Mobile            | <1% |
     |-------------------+-----|

Note that the /mobile/ browsers were primarily older, [[http://bit.ly/NetwrF][WAP-based]] browsers. 

***** 2012 May                                                              :apple:google:microsoft:mozilla:biz:browser:internet:
Browser market share is now:
 
    |-------------------+-------+---------+--------|
    |                   | Total | Desktop | Mobile |
    |-------------------+-------+---------+--------|
    | Internet Explorer |   29% | N/A     | N/A    |
    | Chrome            |   29% | N/A     | N/A    |
    | Firefox           |   23% | N/A     | N/A    |
    | Safari            |    9% | 6%      | 3%     |
    | Opera             |    4% | 2%      | 2%     |
    | Android           |    2% | N/A     | 2%     |
    |-------------------+-------+---------+--------|

  It should be noted that StatCounter limits its statistics to browsers that have had a consistently high market share. As such, it isn't providing statistics for newer mobile browsers such as Firefox on Android (first viable version released [[http://bit.ly/NexjoV][26 June 2012]]), Chrome on Android (released [[http://bit.ly/Nex2lR][29 June 2012]]), Chrome on iOS (released [[http://bit.ly/NewTyL][29 June 2012]] instantly becoming the [[http://bit.ly/NextwD][#1 free app]] for iOS), and, surprisingly, the popular, cross-platform [[http://bit.ly/NexCA5][Dolphin browser]].

  While the market share of those browsers is unclear, it is certain that Internet Explorer, the browser with two thirds of the marketplace in 2008, will lose market share as Windows 7 Mobile has very little [[http://bit.ly/NeyuET][market penetration]].

***** 2006 July                                                             :twitter:news:politics:biz:
[[http://bit.ly/JvoqLE][Twitter was born]]. Since then Twitter, accurately or not, [[http://bit.ly/KILl28][has been credited]] for major political changes such as the so-called [[http://bit.ly/LmdKMY][Arab Spring]]. Currently, Twitter is being used by the [[http://bit.ly/NeBh0R][Colorado Springs]] Fire Department to provide residents timely updates of the [[http://bit.ly/NeBa5b][large fires]] in the area. At the time of writing this, [[http://bit.ly/NeBMI8][@CSFDPIO]] has 3,700 followers and 16 tweets in less than 2 hours.

***** 2012 Mid-May                                                          :twitter:social:biz:
Facebook's frequently, [[http://buswk.co/NeCoO7][maligned by the press]] IPO has seen the company's market capitalization drop by [[http://onforb.es/NeDKs6][$21 billion]] from its initial market capitalization of over $90 billion dollars. While doubtlessly upsetting for investors, Facebook is still worth about $70 billion dollars.

***** 2012 June 30                                                          :RIM:oracle:facebook:google:microsoft:mozilla:biz:
A non-scientific sampling of the market capitalization of high-tech companies:
|------------------+--------------|
| Facebook         | $70 billion  |
| Hewlett Packard  | [[http://yhoo.it/NeFUYB][$37 billion]]  |
| Microsoft        | [[http://yhoo.it/NeGhT4][$257 billion]] |
| Oracle^[1]       | [[http://yhoo.it/NeGCVU][$145 billion]] |
| RIM (Blackberry) | [[http://yhoo.it/N4j8H1][$3.9 billion]] |
| Apple            | [[http://yhoo.it/N4jayx][$546 billion]] |
|                  |              |

^[1] Due to recent acquisitions, Oracle is more accurately described as Oracle + Sun Microsystems + BEA Systems.

I thought about splitting the list into two lists: a /before/ and an /after/ list. But that implies that whatever changes have been happening are done. I certainly don't see signs of that.

***** 2010 October                                                          :home:google:

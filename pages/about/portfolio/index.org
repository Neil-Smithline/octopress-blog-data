While much of my work cannot be demonstrated on a website (eg: middleware doesn't demo well), some of it can be demonstrated.

[[http://bit.ly/Kkbh43][AMO Up Top Version Info]] is an add-on that makes browsing Mozilla's add-ons, frequently called AMO, a little easier. By default, AMO only shows you add-on compatibility version information after you scroll to the bottom of the page and click on the version information box. This add-on duplicates the version information so that it is front and center.

{{{jquery-header(4,Google+)}}}
You can read about what entertains me on [[http://bit.ly/KE1Dwc][Google+]]. This tends to be the more nerdy side of me. I'm always happy to be outgeeked by someone. All my best friends have outgeeked me many times.

{{{jquery-header(4,Facebook)}}}
You can friend me on [[http://on.fb.me/KE1DfP][Facebook]]. It tends to be focused on my personal life. I'm always happy to meet people there. I'm generally good for a game of [[http://bit.ly/L9ZNzT][Words With Friends]]. That said, I still haven't gotten up the nerve to play my buddy, John Van Pelt. He's ranked [[http://bit.ly/L9ZYLJ][ranked 19 in USA Division 1]] championship scheduled for August 2012.

{{{jquery-tab(3,Other Means)}}}

{{{jquery-header(4,My Blog)}}}
My blog, [[http://bit.ly/yGGszW][www.neilsmithline.com]], has some contact information.

{{{jquery-header(4,My Resume)}}}
My resume, [[http://bit.ly/La1uNM][www.neilsmithline.com/resume]], has contact information at the top. As of Mon May 21 00:42:31 2012 (-0400) I am actively job hunting. For personal reasons, I cannot relocate out of the metro-Boston. I am willing to work remotely as well as travel when needed.

{{{jquery-header(4,Disqus Activity)}}}
My [[http://bit.ly/La2d1r][Disqus activity]] has a record of my comments to many articles around the web. I like to think of my Disqus activity as a /redistribution of wisdom/ :-) After making a comment I typically track subsequent comments. This is not a foolproof way to contact me but it may work.

*** Github
I've been spending a lot of time on [[http://www.wikipedia.com/Foss][FOSS]] projects. You can check out some of what I've been doing in my [[http://bit.ly/ygCNdO][Github repositories]].

*** LinkedIn
Se my [[http://linkd.in/KE1CZj][LinkedIn]] page.

*** Facebook
Read up on my personal life on [[http://on.fb.me/KE1DfP][Facebook]].

*** Google+
Read about what entertains me on [[http://bit.ly/KE1Dwc][Google+]]. Due to the difference in users, G+ seems to have more technical types while even my mother is on FB, my G+ activity tends to be more nerdy than my Facebook activity.

*** My Bookmarks
Checkout my bookmark cloud from [[http://bit.ly/KLIdWl][Diigo.com]] @<a href="{{ root_url }}/about/diigo-tag-cloud">bookmark cloud@</a>.

*** My Patents
I've been awarded several @<a href="{{ root_url }}/about/patents">patents@</a> related to computer science. 

*** My Browser Extensions
I've written a Firefox add-on, [[http://bit.ly/Kkbh43][AMO Up Top Version Info]], that makes finding Firefox add-ons for your browser version a little easier. By default, the Mozilla add-ons website, frequently called AMO, displays browser version compatibility only after you click on the version information box that is at the bottom of the add-on page. My add-on duplicates this information so that it is front and center.

Before:
@<img src="{{ root_url }}/assets/screen-snapshots/AMO-Up-Top-Version-Info-Before.png" alt="Before"/> 

After:
@<img src="{{ root_url }}/assets/screen-snapshots/AMO-Up-Top-Version-Info-After.png" alt="After"/> 

Being that [[http://bit.ly/Kkbh43][AMO Up Top Version Info]] is a restartless add-on, you can install it in just a few seconds and then visit a page on AMO such as the [[http://bit.ly/xYcpv7][Scriptish Add-On page]].

I have also written several UserScripts.  UserScripts are tiny web browser add-ons. Some of those that I've written can be found in my [[http://bit.ly/JkwJHB][UserScripts Github repository]]. If you are running [[http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/fx/][Mozilla Firefox]] with either the [[http://bit.ly/Kk9A6R][Greasemonkey]] or [[http://bit.ly/Kk9JHu][Scriptish]] (my favorite) add-ons or using [[http://bit.ly/Kk8PdU][Google Chrome]], you can install them and try them out in just a few seconds.

*** Contact Me

#+END_CENTER

You cannot copy-and-paste the address as it is an image. Sorry about the inconvenience but it prevents spam.

You can also call me at my super-cool phone number: 408-634-5764. Why super-cool you ask? Because the phone number is 408-NEIL SMI, the first 7 letters of my name. Getting the number was quite simple. The only hard part was spending about 2 years until a cool phone number became free.
